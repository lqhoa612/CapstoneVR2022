# MxLabSimVR2022

Project: A Virtual Reality for Mechatronics and Robotic Teaching.

This is my Capstone Project where I used Unity and ROS to simulate robotic arm control in VR.
The project aims to provide users experience controlling a UR3 robot arm in a laboratory environment and promote safety when working with robot.

Here is the link to a video where I go through the details of this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op9TRYQB54k&t=1s
